# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Technologies and Techniques

Dot AI, Co-Working, YouTube, Tutor Hours, TA Zoom Meetings, VS CODE, TT Platform

## Plan on improving the project

I feel like some of the explanations could be better because I think there was one lesson where I was watching the video and the Expert Tutor used the wrong BEM for the entire lesson. It was confusing to watch, as I was trying to make sure I understood everything in the 4th Stage of Sprint 2.
